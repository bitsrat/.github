# BitRat üêÄüíª

**BitRat** is a tech-driven organization focused on exploring the depths of computer graphics, collision detection, simulation algorithms, and other fundamental aspects of computational geometry. From small-scale projects to sophisticated simulations, we aim to provide the building blocks for those who love to tinker with bits and bytes.

## Mission

At BitRat, we aim to craft high-quality, small-scale projects that delve deep into the world of computer graphics, geometric algorithms, and performance optimizations.

## üí° Why BitRat?

- **Minimalist Projects:** We keep it lean. Our projects focus on minimalism and logic, free from the overhead of heavy libraries or engines.
- **Beginner-Friendly:** Each project is structured for learners, with detailed explanations and easy-to-understand implementations.
- **Scalable Solutions:** Even though we start small, many projects can be expanded into more complex systems for those looking to dive deeper.
